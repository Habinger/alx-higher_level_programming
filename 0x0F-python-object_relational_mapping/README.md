# Python - Object-relational mapping
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates Object-relational mapping
> specific to the Python and MySQL programming language

## Description of what each file shows:
* 0-select_states.py: A script that lists all `states` from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`

* 1-filter_states.py: A script that lists all `states` with a `name` starting with `N` (upper N) from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`

* 2-my_filter_states.py: A script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the `states` table of `hbtn_0e_0_usa` where `name` matches the argument.

* 3-my_safe_filter_states.py: A script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the `states` table of `hbtn_0e_0_usa` where `name` matches the argument.

* 4-cities_by_state.py: A script that lists all `cities` from the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa`

* 5-filter_cities.py: A script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all `cities` of that state, using the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa`

* model_state.py: A python file that contains the class definition of a `State` and an instance `Base = declarative_base()`

* 7-model_state_fetch_all.py: A script that lists all `State` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 8-model_state_fetch_first.py: A script that prints the first `State` object from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 9-model_state_filter_a.py: A script that lists all `State` objects that contain the letter `a` from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 10-model_state_my_get.py: A script that prints the `State` object with the `name` passed as argument from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 11-model_state_insert.py: A script that adds the `State` object “Louisiana” to the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 12-model_state_update_id_2.py: A script that changes the name of a `State` object from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 13-model_state_delete_a.py: A script that deletes all `State` objects with a name containing the letter `a` from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

* 14-model_city_fetch_by_state.py, model_city.py: A Python file similar to `model_state.py` named `model_city.py` that contains the class definition of a `City`

* 100-relationship_states_cities.py, relationship_city.py, relationship_state.py: Improves the files `model_city.py` and `model_state.py`, and saves them as `relationship_city.py` and `relationship_state.py`

* 101-relationship_states_cities_list.py: A script that lists all `State` objects, and corresponding `City` objects, contained in the database `hbtn_0e_101_usa`

* 102-relationship_cities_states_list.py: A script that lists all `City` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_101_usa`
