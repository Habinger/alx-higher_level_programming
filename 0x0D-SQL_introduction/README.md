	- second_table description:
		- [ ] `id` INT
		- [ ] `name` VARCHAR(256)
		- [ ] `score` INT

		- [ ] `id` = 1, `name` = “John”, `score` = 10
		- [ ] `id` = 2, `name` = “Alex”, `score` = 3
		- [ ] `id` = 3, `name` = “Bob”, `score` = 14
		- [ ] `id` = 4, `name` = “George”, `score` = 8

    	- The database name will be passed as an argument of the `mysql` command

* 15-groups.sql: A script that lists the number of records with the same score in the table `second_table` of the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.

	- The result should display:
		- [ ] the `score`
		- [ ] the number of records for this `score` with the label `number`
    	- The list should be sorted by the number of records (descending)
